        <p>
          Growing a community around any public and open social application is
          difficult. Despite the benefits decentralised applications offer
          users, many will not be willing to sacrifice the quality of their user
          experience for ideological reasons like decentralisation. The more
          user-friendly and familiar we can make decentralised applications the
          better our chances of them going mainstream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many users view content moderation as an integral part of modern
          social media. Moving to a system where there is no platform level
          content moderation may at best shock some users and at worst{" "}
          <b>cause harm to young or otherwise vulnerable users</b>.
        </p>
        <ContentSectionHeading>
          Chainlink and IPFS enable us to do something not before possible
        </ContentSectionHeading>
        <p>
          Our hackathon project, TrueSight, is a prototype for a new type of{" "}
          <Anchor href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</Anchor> oracle network
          built to provide content moderation data for content of various
          formats hosted on <Anchor href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</Anchor>. For
          our prototype we demonstrate how the TrueSight network could be used
          to calculate moderation labels for images.
        </p>
        <p>
          IPFS uses content addressing to identify content by what it contains
          rather than the location. Using IPFS as a decentralised content
          storage solution fits blockchain applications perfectly. Only the IPFS
          content hash need be stored on-chain and due to the immutable nature
          of content addressing we can be sure of the data we are referencing.
        </p>
        <p>
          An independent network of Chainlink oracles providing image
          classification services can be leveraged by decentralised applications
          to provide <b>transparent</b> and <b>trust-minimised</b> content
          moderation for their users.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our TrueSight prototype both the input images and the calculated
          moderation labels are stored on IPFS and our Chainlink node is
          computing moderation labels off-chain using Amazon Rekognition (a
          cloud-based image classification service) via an external adapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our project also includes a simple demonstration of a usage of this
          prototype through an application where users can upload images which
          are displayed in a public-facing gallery. Any moderation labels which
          are reported by the TrueSight network are displayed as a warning to
          the user before they view the image. If a user is so inclined they are
          able to verify on-chain that the moderation labels were computed
          independently by the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being built with Chainlink the TrueSight network would be completely
          blockchain agnostic but for the purposes of this demo we have decided
          to deploy both it and our demo application on{" "}
          <Anchor href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</Anchor>'s Mumbai
          testnet. We chose to deploy on Polygon both because this project was
          partly inspired by an{" "}
          <Anchor href="#beyond-social-media">
            issue we observed with the Aavegotchi project
          </Anchor>{" "}
          (which is also on Polygon) and being a production-ready layer 2
          solution rapidly growing in popularity we thought it resembles a
          typical environment for many decentralised social applications which
          require the users to make a lot of micro-transactions.

        <ContentSectionHeading>A first line of defence</ContentSectionHeading>
        <p>
          While AI/machine learning solutions are constantly getting better at
          classification, it is extremely difficult for code to make accurate
          judgement about what is deemed acceptable to the majority of people.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may therefore be beneficial for consuming applications to treat the
          moderation labels from the TrueSight network as a first line of
          defence while still allowing users the ability to manually flag
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allowing users to provide feedback on classification results also
          opens up the possibility of incentivising feedback loops to better
          train the classification algorithms powering the TrueSight network.

          It is clear that decentralised social media platforms have huge
          benefits over centralised ones. Users no longer have to trust a
          centralised intermediary who may not have their best interests at
          heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if we want to see mainstream adoption of a decentralised
          social media platform it is highly likely that some form of automated
          content moderation will be required to protect its users.

          I think the issue of moderation is extremely difficult, and you’re
          seeing a lot of centralized companies today struggle with that.
          There’s massive overhead in hiring people, and those people often get
          PTSD [post traumatic stress disorder] because they’re looking at a lot
          of the same graphic things over and over and over again. - Eric Yang,

        <p>
          There are many cases for content moderation outside of social media
          platforms too. One blockchain-based gaming example we have witnessed
          ourselves has been during the recent launch of Aavegotchis which are
          ghost themed tamagotchi style NFTs which are planned to be used in
          virtual meet-ups and mini-games. Players are able to name their
          Aavegotchis anything they wish and the names are shown publicly. Some
          Aavegotchis were given offensive names and some members of the
          Aavegotchi DAO saw this as problematic and raised concern that lack of
          censorship here could have have a negative impact on the growth of the
          game.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this has been managed so far by censoring offensive names in the
          UI layer it may have been beneficial to disallow players from setting
          offensive names for their Aavegotchis on the smart contract layer.
          This would both standardise content moderation across front-end
          clients displaying Aavegotchis and also take the onus of content
          moderation off them.

        <p>
          To better decentralise the TrueSight network a result aggregation
          mechanism could be implemented to allow several independent Chainlink
          nodes to perform their own image classification algorithms before
          coming to consensus about the most correct answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most image classification services will return results in completely
          different formats to one another. Aggregation on results of varying
          formats could be very difficult. It may therefore be beneficial to
          have an agreed upon results format which all nodes in the network must
          map results to before aggregation begins.
